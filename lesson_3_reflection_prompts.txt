When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use remote repository if multiple people were contributing, if you used more than one pc yourself, or you couldn't store data for extended period of time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case someone else screwed up the code temporarily.
