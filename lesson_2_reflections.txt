What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the necessary metadata needed and sets everything up.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a place in between.  It is tracking your file, but nothing you do is set in stone until you commit.
